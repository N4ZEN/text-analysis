Text analytics, also known as text mining, is a process of extracting value from large quantities of unstructured text data. While the text itself is structured to make sense to a human being (i.e. A company report split into sensible sections) it is unstructured from an analytics perspective because it doesnâ€™t fit neatly into a relational database or rows and columns of a spreadsheet. Traditionally, the only structured part of text was the name of the document, the date it was created and who created it. Text analytics is particularly useful for information retrieval, pattern recognition, tagging and annotation, information extraction, sentiment assessment and predictive analytics. It could, for example, shed light on what your customers think of your product or service, or highlight the most common issues that your customers complain about.
